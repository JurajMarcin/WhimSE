WhimSE (or **W**hat **H**ave **I** **M**odified in **SE**Linux Policy) helps
you find modifications in your SELinux Policy that you have no reasonable
explanation for, because they are not from your Linux distribution.

WhimSE scans installed packages for SELinux policies they provide and compares
them with the SElinux policy currently running in your system.
